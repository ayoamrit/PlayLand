Welcome to my game seliing e-commerce website! I've created a dynamic and user-friendly platform using Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging JSP(JavaServer Pages) and Servlets.

This website consists of three main pages: Home, Contact, and Shopping Cart. Let's dive into each of them.
* Home Page:
  On the Home Page, you'll find an extensive collection of exciting games available for purchase. The price of a game can be viewed by hovering onto its image. To add a game to your shopping cart, simply click on the price, and it will be added instantly.
